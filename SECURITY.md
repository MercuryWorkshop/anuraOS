## Reporting a Vulnerability

In the case that you somehow manage to find a vulnerability in Anura please [create a GitHub security advisory.](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory)

REMEMBER: Please DO NOT report vulnerabilities in the repository Issues tab.

## What You Should Report

If you are wondering what counts as a vulnerability, heres a good list:

- XSS in the Anura URL
- The ability to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Anura (not in Anura itself, as this is an intended feature)
- The ability to crash Anura (As in for everyone, not just your browser session)
