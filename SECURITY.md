## Reporting a Vulnerability

In the case that you somehow manage to find a vulnerability in Anura please contact security@mercurywork.shop

REMEMBER: Please DO NOT report vulnerabilities in the repository Issues tab.

## What You Should Report

If you are wondering what counts as a vulnerability, heres a good list:

-   XSS in the Anura URL
-   The ability to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Anura(not in Anura itself, as this is an intended feature)
-   The ability to crash Anura(As in for everyone, not just your browser session)

## Implementing Security(For Project Members and Contributors)

See [SECURITY-BP.md](./documentation/SECURITY-BP.md) for instructions on implementing security in your code.
